# Hex Value Regex Tutorial!

Hello! This short tutorial will help you understand more about how the Regex function (as seen below) works to verify that what you have typed, is actually a proper Hex value! (such as #123456 is a dark shade of cyan-blue!)

## Summary

Do you want to see what the expression looks like? Look no further! The expression below checks to make sure you have a proper hex value input!

`/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`

Pretty cool huh? Let's jump in and learn how it works!

## Regex Components

A regex is considered a literal, so the pattern must be wrapped in slash characters (/).

View our expression below again, you'll notice the sections we are talking about are bolded and cyan!

<span style="color:#6fcb9f; font-weight: bold">/</span>`^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$`<span style="color:#6fcb9f; font-weight: bold">/</span>

(fun fact, instead of just using color:cyan, a certain string of numbers followed by a hash symbol was used ðŸ˜‰)
